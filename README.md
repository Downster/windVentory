# windVentory

windVentory is an Inventory tracking application centered around wind-energy. Users can signup, upload profile pictures, track inventory, and create chatrooms to chat with eachother. 
This project was an idea I had while working as a blade repair technician. A constant source of strife on the job was the lack of organization of inventory on the job.
This would cause duplicate materials to be ordered, and ultimately increase the amount of money spent on each project.
WindVentory aims to cut costs by providing an easy and efficient way to track materials.
